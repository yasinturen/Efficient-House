				A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly 
	used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is 
	desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop. Your friend wants to know 
	how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without dying as a result. Write a 
	program to supply the answer. The program has no input but does have defined 
	constants for the following items: the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill 
	a mouse, the weight of the mouse, the starting weight of the dieter, and the desired 
	weight of the dieter. To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program uses 
	the weight at which the dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current 
	weight, to calculate how much soda pop the dieter can safely drink. You may use 
	any reasonable values for these defined constants. Assume that diet soda contains 
	1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use another named constant for this fraction. 
	You may want to express the percent as the double value 0.001. (If your program 
	turns out not to use a defined constant, you may remove that defined constant 
	from your program.)
